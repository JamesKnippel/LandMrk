- Implement google map  with tappable markers that display text.

- Create login page and allow users to sign up and login.

- Create a map view that allows user to see nearby landmarks on a map.

- Give users the opportunity to create new landmarks and persist data to the Firebase database.

- Create Augmented Reality view in which users can explore landmark 'markers' by geographical location.

- Create more info page that renders data from the Wikipedia API in order to display a more detailed description about landmarks.

- BUG (FIXED): Tapping the more info button displayed data from the most recently added marker, rather than data from the marker that was tapped.

- TO BE DEVELOPED: Tapping the Wikipedia button on the more info page navigates user to the related Wikipedia article in their external browser.

- TO BE DEVELOPED: Tapping the markers in AR view will expand text in an animated, asthetically pleasing fashion.
